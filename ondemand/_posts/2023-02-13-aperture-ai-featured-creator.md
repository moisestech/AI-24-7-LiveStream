## How did Aperture.AI start? Who are the participants? 

**@Aldo:**
Andy and I met by hobby at a photogrammetry workshop at the Centro de Cultura Digital from México. Later we met again on the professional path. We worked for an Interactive Design studio, where we found a space to share interests in interactivity, music, new digital media, and the cultural stories of our ancestors. Sharing these themes was nothing more than an engine to explore and take these and other ideas to their execution in immersive and interactive media.

This gave rise to a time of creative discovery experiences that were very exciting for us, but where there were also too many challenges to get ahead, which gave us learning and strengthened our friendship.

We were the first in line when it came to Machine Learning. I was always surprised by the Machine Learning stuff that Andy showed us, and one of those days we talked about how cool it would be to create an audiovisual project with Artificial Intelligence.


**@Andy:**
Aperture.AI was born as an exploration for making audiovisual experiences with new technological machine learning mediums and deep learning softwares.

Aldo and Andres created Aperture.AI as an audiovisual space for asking how Machine Learning models impact human culture, and how the machine sees its reality, through big data bases of human memory.

## What is the name of your performance and what is the narrative you want to share with people through the set? 

**@Andy:**
Aperture A.I presents: Autonomous Time Teller, wich asks how a machine perceives time , if it's capable of understanding fragments of human history, how it would visualize the past, the present and the future of the same place.

This artwork arises from the narrative about a conscious machine that is capturing data from the north parallel 33° of the planet.

Every 3333 years the Automata narrator powers itself for capture and decipher fragments of the terrestrial time, processes the visual stimuli of its geographical environment to understand its time and store it in its conscious memory processed by artificial intelligence, the intelligent mechanism interprets the information in its own perspective, a machine meta-time that translate the past, the presents, future in binary data. 

The chapters of the performance are: Sumeria, Babylon, Irak, Meta Babylon.

**@Aldo:** 
Being the stories and concepts that I am most passionate about, it didn't take long for me to talk with Andy about a story that would combine science fiction with true real history.

The irruption of a foreign artifact/machine on earth, like a space baby monitor sent by other species, just to find out what's happening here.

This artifact would be created by other intellect, and it would come from another planet or another universe, so the way it captures and sends data would have to be very different.

So I thought it would be interesting to analyze culture in time intervals, exploring the perception of time, and the interpretation of others, thinking that this machine captures its information from the environment, classifies it, and later sends it back to the other universe, where it is received and then restarts the cycle of capture and data send.

In the meantime, in the other universe this process takes 30 hours, but in ours is the equivalent of 3333 years on Earth.

From this back story is how the main narrative develops, about the others cultural interpretation of time spaces by artificial intelligence and by the human spectator.

## What is your inspiration and process? 

**@Aldo:**
Thinking as a stranger on earth, 
I would send the machine to an area where there is validated activity, 
Surely I would use some visible or measurable sensor that gives me the certainty of where something interesting could happen.
So I surely would use an energy sensor for electromagnetic waves and surely I would discover the planetary network of ley lines that surrounds it, which then will lead me to the point that has the most fluctuating energy on the entire globe.

The 33rd parallel north of the planet, (Sumeria, Babylon, Iraq) so this is the enigmatic and amazing place on planet earth that has inspired us.

The conservation of human cultural heritage.

**@Andy:**
We design over the technological determinism thinking, artificial intelligence is taking different artistic mediums to its own massive blackhole for training better Machine Learning models. As the data trained for this show, the people that listen or see our show are taking part of the performance as a node of human experiences or memories shared as pictographic information over the internet, this show would not be possible without the help of the people that sustains the architecture of the multimedia internet information, the Meta-Babylon library.

We like the idea of coding for artistic purposes, and visualize the reality from the perspective of the machine as a path for a better understanding of human consciousness.

## What's coming for Aperture.AI in 2023? 

**@Andy:**
We are about to release a series of audiovisual NTFS which visualize and structure the chapters of the show, we intend to perform a live of the Autonomous Time Teller and take the artificial intelligence sensorial experience to the people, We will prepare new audiovisual, we intend to use different machine learning models along our experiences

**@Aldo:**
The NTFs version of this enigmatic and epic story.


We are happy to pre announce the realease of a 3 years show work soon on AI.24 Artificial Intelligence LiveStream.

This electronic music ensemble is made up of:
Andrés Cedillo Chincoya (Alexander Kessler) a Software Developer and Creative Technologist, focused on sound art, generative design, computer vision and Deep Learning. 
And Aldo Prado (Aldo Parallel) an Interactive Art Director and Creative Technologist focused on Concept Design, Interactive Installations, Storytelling and Machine Learning.


 Aperture A.I presents a Metaverse A.I Live Show : The Autonomous Time Teller, which asks how a machine perceives time, if it's capable of understanding fragments of human history, how it would visualize the past, the present and the future of the same place.

This artwork arises from the narrative about a conscious machine that is capturing data from the north parallel 33° of the planet.

Every 3333 years the Automata narrator powers itself for capture and decipher fragments of the terrestrial time, processes the visual stimuli of its geographical environment to understand its time and store it in its conscious memory processed by artificial intelligence, the intelligent mechanism interprets the information in its own perspective, a machine meta-time that translate the past, the presents, future in binary data.

Soon on A.I24 Artificial Intelligence LiveStream
